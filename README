This software (originaly written in 2004) has been verified to still perform as intended, 
however, it isn't likely the fastest method for accomplishing its task.
People have already forked this code years ago, but this is the last release
I had ever made public.

Below is the original README file from 2004 with some slight modifications re: Requirements.
